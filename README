# Food Truck Finder App

This is a web application that helps users find nearby food trucks. It provides information about food trucks in the area and displays their locations on a map.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Download and install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started). Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS but requires separate installation on Linux. You can install Docker Compose by following the instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to start the application:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the Food Truck Finder app.

## Additional Notes

- This application uses the Google Maps React API for displaying maps and markers.

- The data used in the application is sourced from the Palo Alto Food Trucks dataset.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, additional features could be implemented, such as:

- Embedding Google Reviews for food trucks.
- Parsing menu options and providing more detailed information about each food truck.
- Enhancing the user interface and user experience.
