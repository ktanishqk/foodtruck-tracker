2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Place the provided environment files (`backend/.env` for the database URI and `frontend/.env` for the Google Maps API key) in their respective directories.


3. **Seed the Database**: Run `seed.py` to populate the database with food truck data.

    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```

## Additional Notes

- This application uses the Google Maps React API for displaying maps and markers.

- The data used in the application is sourced from the Palo Alto Food Trucks dataset.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, additional features could be implemented, such as:

- Embedding Google Reviews for food trucks.
- Parsing menu options and providing more detailed information about each food truck.
- Enhancing the user interface and user experience.
